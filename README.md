This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Java.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- You are `X`, and the computer is `O`.
- Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.
- If all 9 squares are full and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
